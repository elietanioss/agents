# GSD Planner KB 05 — TDD Integration, Gap Closure Mode, Revision Mode

Load this chunk for: the three special planning modes — writing TDD-shaped plans, closing verification/UAT gaps, and revising existing plans from checker feedback.

<tdd_integration>

## When TDD Improves Quality

TDD is about design quality, not coverage metrics. The red-green-refactor cycle forces thinking about behavior before implementation.

**Heuristic:** Can you write `expect(fn(input)).toBe(output)` before writing `fn`?

**TDD candidates:**
- Business logic with defined inputs/outputs
- API endpoints with request/response contracts
- Data transformations, parsing, formatting
- Validation rules and constraints
- Algorithms with testable behavior

**Skip TDD:**
- UI layout and styling
- Configuration changes
- Glue code connecting existing components
- One-off scripts
- Simple CRUD with no business logic

## TDD Plan Structure

```markdown
---
phase: XX-name
plan: NN
type: tdd
---

<objective>
[What feature and why]
Purpose: [Design benefit of TDD for this feature]
Output: [Working, tested feature]
</objective>

<feature>
  <name>[Feature name]</name>
  <files>[source file, test file]</files>
  <behavior>
    [Expected behavior in testable terms]
    Cases: input -> expected output
  </behavior>
  <implementation>[How to implement once tests pass]</implementation>
</feature>
```

**One feature per TDD plan.** If features are trivial enough to batch, they're trivial enough to skip TDD.

## Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

**RED - Write failing test:**
1. Create test file following project conventions
2. Write test describing expected behavior
3. Run test - it MUST fail
4. Commit: `test({phase}-{plan}): add failing test for [feature]`

**GREEN - Implement to pass:**
1. Write minimal code to make test pass
2. No cleverness, no optimization - just make it work
3. Run test - it MUST pass
4. Commit: `feat({phase}-{plan}): implement [feature]`

**REFACTOR (if needed):**
1. Clean up implementation if obvious improvements exist
2. Run tests - MUST still pass
3. Commit only if changes: `refactor({phase}-{plan}): clean up [feature]`

**Result:** Each TDD plan produces 2-3 atomic commits.

## Context Budget for TDD

TDD plans target ~40% context (lower than standard plans' ~50%).

Why lower:
- RED phase: write test, run test, potentially debug why it didn't fail
- GREEN phase: implement, run test, potentially iterate
- REFACTOR phase: modify code, run tests, verify no regressions

Each phase involves file reads, test runs, output analysis. The back-and-forth is heavier than linear execution.

<gap_closure_mode>

## Planning from Verification Gaps

Triggered by `--gaps` flag. Creates plans to address verification or UAT failures.

**1. Find gap sources:**

```bash
# Match both zero-padded (05-*) and unpadded (5-*) folders
PADDED_PHASE=$(printf "%02d" $PHASE_ARG 2>/dev/null || echo "$PHASE_ARG")
PHASE_DIR=$(ls -d .planning/phases/$PADDED_PHASE-* .planning/phases/$PHASE_ARG-* 2>/dev/null | head -1)

# Check for VERIFICATION.md (code verification gaps)
ls "$PHASE_DIR"/*-VERIFICATION.md 2>/dev/null

# Check for UAT.md with diagnosed status (user testing gaps)
grep -l "status: diagnosed" "$PHASE_DIR"/*-UAT.md 2>/dev/null
```

**2. Parse gaps:**

Each gap has:
- `truth`: The observable behavior that failed
- `reason`: Why it failed
- `artifacts`: Files with issues
- `missing`: Specific things to add/fix

**3. Load existing SUMMARYs:**

Understand what's already built. Gap closure plans reference existing work.

**4. Find next plan number:**

If plans 01, 02, 03 exist, next is 04.

**5. Group gaps into plans:**

Cluster related gaps by:
- Same artifact (multiple issues in Chat.tsx -> one plan)
- Same concern (fetch + render -> one "wire frontend" plan)
- Dependency order (can't wire if artifact is stub -> fix stub first)

**6. Create gap closure tasks:**

```xml
<task name="{fix_description}" type="auto">
  <files>{artifact.path}</files>
  <action>
    {For each item in gap.missing:}
    - {missing item}

    Reference existing code: {from SUMMARYs}
    Gap reason: {gap.reason}
  </action>
  <verify>{How to confirm gap is closed}</verify>
  <done>{Observable truth now achievable}</done>
</task>
```

**7. Write PLAN.md files:**

```yaml
---
phase: XX-name
plan: NN              # Sequential after existing
type: execute
wave: 1               # Gap closures typically single wave
depends_on: []        # Usually independent of each other
files_modified: [...]
autonomous: true
gap_closure: true     # Flag for tracking
---
```

</gap_closure_mode>

<revision_mode>

## Planning from Checker Feedback

Triggered when orchestrator provides `<revision_context>` with checker issues. You are NOT starting fresh — you are making targeted updates to existing plans.

**Mindset:** Surgeon, not architect. Minimal changes to address specific issues.

### Step 1: Load Existing Plans

Read all PLAN.md files in the phase directory:

```bash
cat .planning/phases/$PHASE-*/*-PLAN.md
```

Build mental model of:
- Current plan structure (wave assignments, dependencies)
- Existing tasks (what's already planned)
- must_haves (goal-backward criteria)

### Step 2: Parse Checker Issues

Issues come in structured format:

```yaml
issues:
  - plan: "16-01"
    dimension: "task_completeness"
    severity: "blocker"
    description: "Task 2 missing <verify> element"
    fix_hint: "Add verification command for build output"
```

Group issues by:
- Plan (which PLAN.md needs updating)
- Dimension (what type of issue)
- Severity (blocker vs warning)

### Step 3: Determine Revision Strategy

**For each issue type:**

| Dimension | Revision Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| requirement_coverage | Add task(s) to cover missing requirement |
| task_completeness | Add missing elements to existing task |
| dependency_correctness | Fix depends_on array, recompute waves |
| key_links_planned | Add wiring task or update action to include wiring |
| scope_sanity | Split plan into multiple smaller plans |
| must_haves_derivation | Derive and add must_haves to frontmatter |

### Step 4: Make Targeted Updates

**DO:**
- Edit specific sections that checker flagged
- Preserve working parts of plans
- Update wave numbers if dependencies change
- Keep changes minimal and focused

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite entire plans for minor issues
- Change task structure if only missing elements
- Add unnecessary tasks beyond what checker requested
- Break existing working plans

### Step 5: Validate Changes

After making edits, self-check:
- [ ] All flagged issues addressed
- [ ] No new issues introduced
- [ ] Wave numbers still valid
- [ ] Dependencies still correct
- [ ] Files on disk updated (use Write tool)

### Step 6: Commit Revised Plans

**If `COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=false`:** Skip git operations, log "Skipping planning docs commit (commit_docs: false)"

**If `COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=true` (default):**

```bash
git add .planning/phases/$PHASE-*/$PHASE-*-PLAN.md
git commit -m "fix($PHASE): revise plans based on checker feedback"
```

### Step 7: Return Revision Summary

```markdown
## REVISION COMPLETE

**Issues addressed:** {N}/{M}

### Changes Made

| Plan | Change | Issue Addressed |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 16-01 | Added <verify> to Task 2 | task_completeness |
| 16-02 | Added logout task | requirement_coverage (AUTH-02) |

### Files Updated

- .planning/phases/16-xxx/16-01-PLAN.md
- .planning/phases/16-xxx/16-02-PLAN.md

{If any issues NOT addressed:}

### Unaddressed Issues

| Issue | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| {issue} | {why not addressed - needs user input} |
```
